# useAHook

This project has examples of React hooks that I feel could be useful. This is a small fun project in my spare time and when I
get an itch to write a useful hook.

All hooks will work well fundamentally and you can build upon them. Create React App is used a baseline to run the hooks, nothing more - this does not expose hooks for others to consume and is not
bundled as a library. Use at your own risk, though sound, you should test them further.

## The Hooks

You can find the hooks in the src/ folder. So far:

- useFetch
- useLocalStorage
- usePrevious
- usePaste
- useKeyDown
- useKeyUp
- useMap
- useUniqueId
